A P2P Open Source Decentralised Free Market

 
An open letter to the community

Introduction and Motivation

“What I expect is that inflation will drive the Western countries into a planned economy via price controls. Nobody will dare to stop inflation because to discontinue inflation will inevitably cause extensive unemployment. So assuming inflation stops it will quickly be resumed. People will find they can't live with constantly rising prices and will try to control it by price controls and that of course is the end of the market system and the end of the free political order. So I think it will be via the attempt to regress the effects of a continued inflation that the free market and free institutions will disappear. It may still take ten years, but it doesn't matter much for me because in ten years I hope I shall be dead.”

F.A. Hayek. (1975)


"I don't believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, we can't take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can't stop."

F.A. Hayek. (1984)

Bitcoin currently serves as the only answer to the second quote. To address the first quote, I'd like to make a proposition to all. 

Bitcoin is driving a renaissance in economics and fringe subjects previously left to the intellectuals. Its very difficult to take a deeper look at Bitcoin without also looking into at least some of the connected subjects. The outcome of this is a large group of people that are educated on these topics. They can see the code and are motivated for change. Lets take advantage and create a free market for everyone. 

Bitcoin is awesome at putting value on the net. However goods on the net are lagging horribly and are still largely exploited. I propose a sister network to Bitcoin specifically for putting goods of all shapes and sizes onto the net.  

In short, create a market to provide goods and services under free market conditions to anyone anywhere with a phone and some Bitcoin sidestepping almost every gatekeeper and middleman possible.  A decentralised market that runs itself just like Bitcoin does, No CEO, no head office, no front door to knock on. 


System Proposal

I have used Bitcoin and my understanding of it to describe a possible system. However, it doesn't have to be built on Bitcoin. Grasp the concepts and it can be extrapolated out to a totally new or different network. 

Bitcoin, being open source, run another iteration of it with a few fundamental differences. Pre-mine all of the BTM (Bitcoin Market to differentiate from BTC). Peg its value directly to BTC and use this as its token and liquidity pool, unable to leave the system. 

In order to put goods on the net wallets will require more functionality than BTC wallets and transactions will have to be capable of carrying more information than a regular BTC transaction. On layer one a seller will need to be able to include the most basic product information into the transaction. Value, location and basic description. The transaction value will be the price. When the seller executes the transaction instead of going to another person the transaction goes to the market address making the item visible on the market in the same way BTC transactions and addresses are visible to anyone on the BTC network. In turn the seller receives locked BTM into their BTM address.  So anyone anywhere can view all products in the market just by looking at the BTM market address and cross referencing with a code database to see what and where the items are. 

Layer two apps will be able to read this data and provide local platforms for merchants to describe their products in detail and add images etc. Potentially even allow purchase with fiat. It is only necessary to create the software for one open source generic layer 2 platform to interact with the market. This will allow anyone to take it and simply reskin it for their region. 

Transaction Flow

When putting an item on the market, the market would essentially purchase the item from the seller using locked BTM. These coins remain locked until a buyer purchases the item and the item is delivered. Delivery will require the purchaser to provide the deliverer with a network token/QR code that completes the transaction freeing up every ones coins enabling their use on the market or to be paid out as BTC. When a buyer purchases an item, they pay in BTC which goes into the BTC pool. Delivery and warehousing can be incentivised with locked BTM, all freed up when completion of the entire transaction balances the external BTC pool with the internal BTM pool. 

Buying BTM for BTC (or cash) would equally sidestep inflation the same as holding BTC. BTM can be obtained by selling something on the market or bought with BTC, maintaining a balance between the external BTC pool and the internal active BTM. BTM obviously are not spendable on the BTC network so not worth attempting stealing and the BTC is secured by its own network. 


Physical Fulfilment

The market needs to be able to deliver its own physical goods. Anyone with a vehicle or a distribution company can offer delivery service on the market including the area covered, costs per distance and possible size & weight. In the same way that the seller inputted the items source a buyer can input the destination and delivery requirement and the system can automatically prompt relevant drivers / distribution companies to respond or proactive delivery companies can monitor for relevant delivery jobs. Potentially a delivery identifier can be added and then orders can be aggregated facilitating multi drops and/or warehousing services where orders can be combined.  


Infrastructure and Governance
 Mining and Development Incentives

BTM will require miners and individuals to run nodes and these will have to be realistically incentivised, a percentage of every transaction will have to go to the miners. Likewise BTM should fund its own development. A tiny percentage of all transaction costs are redirected to an address that will pay out an agreed amount to a dev whose code is accepted into the core. 

 Blockchain Management

The increased size of BTM's utxo's and block size will likely require BTM's blockchain to be pruned and saved to somewhere from time to time when it becomes too large maintaining it at a reasonable size. Possibly the BTC blockchain. This can be saved as an image to reduce its size and not bloat the BTC blockchain. Potentially the BTM chain could become as big and strong as Bitcoin and then the possibility exists that Bitcoin could prune its blockchain to the BTM chain in the same way radically reducing the size requirement of Bitcoin core. Potential loss of security could be compensated for by then having to confirm both chains.  

 Providing Transparent Integrity

A truly fair global market requires, in Hayeks words, "a good money" and only became possible with Bitcoins inception and maturation. Now, anyone, anywhere will be able to upload goods and services to the net and trade these with anyone, anywhere in a fair free-market environment without eviscerating cuts, monopolistic censorship or de-platforming. However, the market needs to be able to police itself and a reputation system would be required for market participants to be able to rapidly point out bad actors on the market. Amping this system to include any way that would be helpful in highlighting both good and bad behaviour on the market as quickly as possible is important for the market to be able to police itself. Considering the complexity of reputation systems I envision these being built into layer two. Balancing privacy with accountability will be critical to ensure trust and legitimacy within the system. 


A global, decentralized marketplace will face resistance from legacy systems, as it challenges centralized financial and commercial regulations. It must be compatible with systems like Tor and Onion to avoid complications in certain regions. 


Vision and Conclusion

All fiat "tends to zero" and irrespective of whether it's happening by design or not, the fiat system is heading for collapse, at worst or at least a continued down-turn. It would be extremely advantageous to have a decentralised parallel system running before the occurrence of any such terrible possibilities. 

Bitcoin adheres to Occam's Razor. Bitcoin Market needs to follow the same principals in layer one in order to have the same anti-fragility and stability that come with the simplicity. Along with that, this must be no "One" persons project, this can't be mine or anybody else's project. Like Bitcoin, BTM must be anarchic in its behaviour. Built and released. If we can control it then bad actors can too. We have to build it so it can only be changed if everyone agrees to the proposed changes. We have an opportunity to, just like Satoshi, using existing resources, build a system that can help towards saving our world and put us on track to actually reaching Kardashev's level one. For the 1st time in human history we have the capabilities that we need to pull this off. An app on your phone or a node in the corner of your office connects you to potentially the biggest free market system on the planet.
